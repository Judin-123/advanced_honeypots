# ML-Powered Honeypot Implementation

A dynamic, machine learning-powered honeypot system that adapts its behavior based on real-time threat analysis. This implementation focuses on delivering core functionality with strategic scope reduction for a 3-month development timeline.

## üéØ Project Overview

This ML-powered honeypot system demonstrates the core innovation of **dynamic adaptation** - the honeypot changes its behavior based on machine learning analysis of attacker patterns. The system classifies attackers into three threat levels (scanner, amateur, advanced) and automatically adjusts the honeypot's responses accordingly.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Threat Classification**: XGBoost-based ML model categorizes attackers
- **Dynamic Behavior Adaptation**: Honeypot automatically switches between profiles
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Web dashboard with real-time metrics and visualizations
- **Elasticsearch Integration**: Centralized log storage and querying
- **Automated Response**: System adapts without human intervention

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Cowrie SSH Honeypot**: Primary honeypot generating attack data
2. **Feature Extractor**: Processes logs to extract behavioral features
3. **Threat Classifier**: XGBoost model for threat level prediction
4. **Dynamic Adaptation Engine**: Modifies honeypot behavior based on ML predictions
5. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Web interface for system visualization

### Honeypot Profiles

- **Minimal**: For scanners - limited responses, resource conservation
- **Standard**: For amateurs - default Cowrie configuration
- **Deception**: For advanced threats - enhanced countermeasures, fake files

## üöÄ Quick Start
